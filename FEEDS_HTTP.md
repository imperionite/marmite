- The test suite for the `/feed/` endpoint validates its core functionalities:
  - Basic retrieval of the feed
  - Filtering based on user preferences
  - Authentication requirements
- The `setUp` method initializes the testing environment by:
  - Creating several user accounts
  - Creating a set of posts
  - Setting up a follow relationship between two users
  - Simulating a like action from one user to a post
- The test cases:
  - **test_feed_view_authenticated**: Verifies that an authenticated user can retrieve the feed successfully, ensuring a 200 OK response and the correct number of posts.
  - **test_feed_view_followed_filter**: Checks the filtering of posts from followed users, ensuring that only posts from users the authenticated user is following are included in the response.
  - **test_feed_view_liked_filter**: Validates the filtering for liked posts, ensuring that only posts liked by the authenticated user are returned.
  - **test_feed_view_unauthenticated**: Confirms that unauthenticated users are denied access to the feed, resulting in a 401 UNAUTHORIZED response.
- These tests ensure the `/feed/` endpointâ€™s reliability and adherence to its specifications.
