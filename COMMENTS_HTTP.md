## Comments

The subsequent images represent the screenshots captured from the sample HTTP calls related to `comments` to evaluate and validate the REST API endpoints. For this updates majority of the endpoints now are `protected` with access token provided by JWT except for the the **creation of new user** and **user login**. The compilation of sample HTTP requests generated from the [connectly-api](https://github.com/imperionite/marmite/tree/main/connectly-api) (Django REST API project) is available for review in the [comments.http file](https://github.com/imperionite/marmite/blob/main/comments.http).

**Important Note Regarding Screenshot Data and Data Fixtures:**

Please be aware that some screenshots in this file were captured during the initial phases of development, *prior* to the implementation of [Django data fixtures](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/db/fixtures/) for database seeding. As a result, the specific data values displayed in those earlier screenshots may not precisely match the data currently generated by the fixtures. However, the core API functionality and the expected behavior of the `/posts/comments` endpoint, such as proper handling of requests and responses, remain consistent. New tests will explicitly utilize data generated by the fixtures to ensure ongoing alignment with the current database state. The purpose of including these screenshots is to demonstrate the initial API validation process. You may check the [README.md's Initial Data Seeding](https://github.com/imperionite/marmite/blob/main/README.md#ids) section for details.
