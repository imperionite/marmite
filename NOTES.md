## **Manual Testing Checklist**
1. **Authentication**  
   - Register a user.  
   - Login to get a JWT token.  
   - Access protected endpoints using the token.  

2. **Users**  
   - Create, retrieve, update, and delete users.  
   - Check that only authorized users can modify or delete their accounts.  

3. **Posts**  
   - Create, retrieve, update, and delete posts.  
   - Ensure only the author can modify or delete their posts.  

4. **Likes & Unlikes**  
   - Test liking and unliking a post.  
   - Ensure duplicate likes are prevented.  

5. **Comments**  
   - Test creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting comments.  
   - Ensure only comment authors can edit/delete their comments.  

6. **Permissions & Errors**  
   - Verify unauthorized users cannot create posts/comments.  
   - Check error responses for invalid requests (e.g., unliking a post that wasn't liked).

## **Explicit Endpoints Verification** âœ…

| **Method** | **Endpoint**             | **Exists in Your Code?** | **Location in Code** |
|------------|-------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| `POST`     | `/posts/users/login/`   | âœ… Yes | `LoginView` in `views.py` |
| `POST`     | `/posts/`               | âœ… Yes | `create()` in `PostViewSet` |
| `GET`      | `/posts/{id}/`          | âœ… Yes | `retrieve()` in `PostViewSet` |
| `POST`     | `/posts/{id}/like/`     | âœ… Yes | `like()` action in `PostViewSet` |
